# MiddleClick-AHK-scripts
small scripts for AHK for binding middle mouse to diffrent keys


#What? 

I made this because when i switched back to windows i missed the ability to be able to press left and right on my touchpad to middleclick, and since my scroll wheel is broken this script is perfect for those who miss the taste of a gnome middle click or who dont have a middle mouse button
