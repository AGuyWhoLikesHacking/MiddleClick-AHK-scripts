# MiddleClick-AHK-scripts
small scripts for AHK for binding middle mouse to diffrent keys


# What? 

I made this because when i switched back to windows i missed the ability to be able to press left and right on my touchpad to middleclick, and since my scroll wheel is broken this script is perfect for those who miss the taste of a gnome middle click or who dont have a middle mouse button 


PS: The script that does middle mouse clicks will not work on shooter games since you wont be able to look down sight and shoot since that both invovles the pressing of both left and right on your mouse, feel free to change this bind https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm
